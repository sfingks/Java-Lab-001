## In computer jargon, whatâ€™s the difference between a statement and a comment?
A statement is part of the program that tells the computer what to do. A comment does not affect the program, but is readable by someone looking at the code and can be used for notation and organization.
## What does it mean to say that a program is portable?
It means that it can be run on different types of machines, each of which will translate the program into their native machine language.
## In common English, what does the word compile mean?
To compile is to take the high-level language that a program is written in and translate it into lower-level languages, or machine languages, that the computer can then read and act on.
## What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?
And executable is a program that has already been translated into a machine language and is ready to be "executed" or run by the computer.
